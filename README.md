This thesis focuses on the development of compact and power efficient VCO based ADC for implantable biomedical devices. Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)-based ADCs offer a promising avenue for these applications due to their inherent compatibility with scaled CMOS technologies and digital-friendly operation, though achieving high linearity and low phase noise remains challenging. This thesis details the design, comprehensive analysis, and post-layout verification of an area-efficient, low-power 4-bit VCO-based ADC tailored for biomedical applications, implemented in 90nm CMOS technology.The core of the converter is a novel five-stage current-starved ring oscillator (CSRO) which incorporates a diode-connected NMOS source degeneration technique to enhance voltage-to-frequency (V-F) linearity and an embedded charge pump mechanism within alternating delay stages to mitigate phase noise. Post-layout simulations demonstrate the VCO's robust performance under a 1.8V supply, achieving a wide tuning range from 38 MHz to 619 MHz (93.86\%) for control voltages between 0.53V and 1.6V. It exhibits a phase noise of -88.63 dBc/Hz at a 1MHz offset from a 323 MHz carrier, while consuming 354.6 µW. This translates to a Figure of Merit (FOM) of -141.15 dBc/Hz within a compact layout area of 292.94 µm².The ADC architecture further employs a Frequency-to-Digital Converter (FDC) stage, for which both asynchronous (ripple) and synchronous 4-bit counter implementations, along with a D-Flip-Flop based output register, were designed and comparatively evaluated. The complete 4-bit ADC system utilizing the synchronous counter demonstrates superior dynamic performance, achieving an Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of 3.64 bits (600KHz) and more better at lower frequency. Static characterization reveals a Differential Non-Linearity (DNL) within ±0.6 LSB and an Integral Non-Linearity (INL) between -0.04 and +0.72 LSB, ensuring monotonicity. The overall ADC consumes 328.3 µW, resulting in an FoM of 0.642 pJ/Conversion-step.Extensive simulations, including process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations and Monte Carlo analyses, validate the design's functionality and robustness. The comparative investigation of FDC architectures provides crucial insights for optimizing performance based on specific application priorities.
